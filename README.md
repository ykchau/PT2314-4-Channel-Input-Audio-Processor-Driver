# PT2314-Driver
This is a basic driver of PT2314, for the LaLiMat Project, and is based on Arduino or ESP
For easy reuse in other projects, I didn't make it specific for LaLiMat, so you can use this in your project with little modification. 

# Note
Although this driver is for PT2314, I highly recommend you use PT2314E if you are using it's I2C, because there are some problems with the original PT2314 chips during I2C communication.

# What is the LaLiMat project
LaLiMat is a multi-function Pixel Display, similar to LaMetric Time/Awtrix, more details can be found here :
